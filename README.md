# Fetch-Rewards-Coding-Exercise
In this exercise, I worked with the receipts.json, brands.json, and users.json to build a new structured relational data model, answer  questions from a business stakeholder by writing SQL queries, identify Data Quality Issues, and communicate with Stakeholders.

1. Review Existing Unstructured Data and Diagram a New Structured Relational Data Model
2. Write a query that directly answers a predetermined question from a business stakeholder
3. Evaluate Data Quality Issues in the Data Provided
4. Communicate with Stakeholders
